<h1>Pupin coils</h1>

<p>Pupin's 1899 patent for loading coils, archaically called "Pupin coils", followed closely on the pioneering work of the<br> English physicist and mathematician Oliver Heaviside, which predates Pupin's patent by some seven years. The<br> importance of the patent was made clear when the American rights to it were acquired by American Telephone &<br> Telegraph (AT&T), making him wealthy. Although AT&T bought Pupin's patent, they made little use of it, as they<br> already had their own development in hand led by George Campbell and had up to this point been challenging Pupin<br> with Campbell's own patent. AT&T were afraid they would lose control of an invention which was immensely<br> valuable due to its ability to greatly extend the range of long distance telephones and especially submarine ones.</p>
